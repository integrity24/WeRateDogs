# WeRateDogs
Data Analytics Udacity Nanodegree Project
This project is a data wrangling and analysis of WeRateDogs tweet archive based on Twitter data provided. WeRateDogs Enhanced Twitter archive contains data extracted from 2356 of the 5000+ tweets posted between the 15th of November 2015 and the 1st of August 2017 from the @dog_rates Twitter account archive.

My analysis is based on the source of the tweets, popular dog names, and the month of the year with the highest tweet count.
After analyzing the data, the following insights were obtained:
1. The most commonly used device to tweet is the iPhone as shown in the record below.
2. One of the outcomes that I was able to reach this dataset provided is the most common name used for the dogs. According to the data, the name ‘Charlie’ is the most common name with 11 mentions, ‘Tucker’, ‘Oliver’, ‘Lucy’ and ‘Penny’ all mentioned 10 times.
3. The golden retriever is the most common breed of dog on the first prediction.
